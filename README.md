Plant-CareTaker
The program will work to water the plant automatically when the moisture content in the soil reduces from a certain threshold value and also the user can control it from the phone too
The project mainly workes with arduino uno, the automisation is done by using the relay switch and mouisture sensour programed with arduino, according to the value  of dielectric mesured by the moisture sensour the program gives the comand to the relay switch and relay switch turns on the water source 
the predefined threshold dielectric above which the water source should be turned on is 200 
now according to the program when the dielectric reduces 200 the arduino turns on the relay switch and allow to power up the water source for 5 sec 
now another feature of our program is that it also sends the notification to the user on their phones about the water source 
and we give an extra access to the user so that the user can also turn on and off the water source from his phone itself
in the program we use relay switch and moisture sensour to mesure the dielectric and automise the water sorce 
the arduino notification app and its libraries are used to send notification in the users mobile phone 
the bluetooth module and relay switch is used to give direct access to the user from his phone
